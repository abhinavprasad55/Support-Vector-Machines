SVM and Grid Search using Python


SVMs are Supervised Learning models with associated learning algorithms analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis. 

It is non-probablistic binary linear classifier. Given a set of training example, each marked for belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other. 

The classes are divided a line called "Hyperplane". We choose a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes. 

The vector points (or the points in graph) that touches the margin lines are known as 'Support Vectors', hence the name Support Vector Machines
